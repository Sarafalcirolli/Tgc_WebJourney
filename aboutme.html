        <h1 >About me</h1>
            <p>Since forever, the realm of technology has held an 
            irresistible fascination for me. The ceaseless curiosity for 
            this tech world has always been a constant in my life. 
            <br>For five years, my professional path led me to technical support, an 
            experience rich in challenges, yet it didn't fully reveal my 
            true passion: development. The idea of delving into codes and 
            crafting digital solutions lay dormant but on the verge of 
            awakening. 
            <br>Today, twelve  years after embarking on this 
            professional journey, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to 
            commence my true venture into the field of technology. This is
            the moment to turn my curiosity into tangible knowledge, 
            to absorb every line of code as part of a unique language. 
            <br>I'm eager to soak up everything this journey has to offer, to 
            learn, grow, and, above all, to apply these newfound skills in 
            practice. May this phase be filled with discoveries, challenges 
            overcome, and achievements.
