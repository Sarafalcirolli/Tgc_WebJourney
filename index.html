                    and I'm thrilled to welcome you all to my new digital 
                    space!</h1>

                <p> As an enthusiastic student of Full Stack Web Development,
                    I've created this Website to share my learning journey, 
                    some small projects, and, of course, a bit about myself!
                    <br><br>   
                    Here, you'll find details about weekly challenges, 
                    insights into the vast world of web development,
                    and perhaps even some valuable tips that I'm picking
                    up along the way.</p>

            <h1 >About me</h1>
                <p>Since forever, the realm of technology has held an 
                irresistible fascination for me. The ceaseless curiosity for 
                this tech world has always been a constant in my life. 
                <br>For five years, my professional path led me to technical support, an 
                experience rich in challenges, yet it didn't fully reveal my 
                true passion: development. The idea of delving into codes and 
                crafting digital solutions lay dormant but on the verge of 
                awakening. 
                <br>Today, twelve  years after embarking on this 
                professional journey, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to 
                commence my true venture into the field of technology. This is
                the moment to turn my curiosity into tangible knowledge, 
                to absorb every line of code as part of a unique language. 
                <br>I'm eager to soak up everything this journey has to offer, to 
                learn, grow, and, above all, to apply these newfound skills in 
                practice. May this phase be filled with discoveries, challenges 
                overcome, and achievements.
